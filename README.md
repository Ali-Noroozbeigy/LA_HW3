This homework has 3 parts to implement.

In first Part, the goal is to show how many times a color is repeated in a picture with a bar chart. This part is done using two Python library matplotlib and numpy.

In second part, the goal is to make a sheared shadow of a picture with white background and then combine it with the original image so that we will have the original picture with a shadow behind it.
